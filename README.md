# The New Political Election Graphics

Graphic design generation for TNP's Campaign Finances project.

Takes CSV files from fec.gov and ohiosos.gov and uses Python to parse the data into simpler data that can be more easily interpreted in R, which will generate the graphics.

Right now I'm working on getting rid of R and using Matplotlib so the whole application can be handled in Python rather than splitting it between Python and R.
